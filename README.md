1. Change to 'CHIP-tools' folder: `cd CHIP-tools`
1. Modify permissions: `sudo chmod 755 *.sh`
1. Execute setup script: `bash setup.sh`
1. Execute `FEL='sudo sunxi-fel' FASTBOOT='sudo fastboot' SNIB=false`
1. Execute tool to flash CHIP:
    * With local firmware: `./chip-update-firmware.sh -L ./stable-server-b149`
    * Downloading remote firmware: `./chip-update-firmware.sh`
1. When "Waiting for fel......" prompt appears, connect CHIP to the host computer with a microUSB cable.
1. When "FLASH VERIFICATION COMPLETE" message appears, flashing is successful.
1. Disconnect CHIP from PC
1. Remove jumper wire between FEL and GND pins.
1. Connect CHIP to host computer again.
